# EdiSplitter

Receives AF packets from [EdiHttp](https://github.com/hradio/edihttp) or other EDI sources and decodes the full 
DAB Ensemble into single service EDI streams.
It also decodes DAB Dynamic Label Plus for segmentation of the linear radio programme for 
server based timeshift scenarios and DAB MOT SlideShow for visual thumbnails.
